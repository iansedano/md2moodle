To get the JavaScript juices flowing,
this module project is to make a simple landing page for whatever you want.
It could be a portfolio page or a presentation page for an artist.
Here you will focus on making it a template,
something that you can easily adapt to any kind of landing page you want.

Building a site in this way, as components of a larger project,
will also start to get you in the right mindset needed
for tackling those larger projects that you will be faced with professionally.
Code bases so large that can take _years_ to understand every bit of it.
When you can start breaking down tasks
and building components that are nicely bounded and well defined,
this is when you start to come into your own.

To aid in this,
the website you will now make will be generated from a json file.
Then you will plug in some ready-made recipes for a couple of sites,
and the JavaScript will build it out for you.

To aid in all of this, and to get you to start thinking of components,
libraries and separation of concerns,
you will build your own micro-throwaway-library to help.
That is, you will write a few DOM functions
that will decrease the amount of typing needed to create elements,
to get you to think about the different ways this process can be abstracted.
